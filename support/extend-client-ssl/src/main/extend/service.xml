  <!--
    Default ClientSSL bean which will read keystore from:
    keystore.jks, config/keystore.jks, keystore.pkcs12 or config/keystore.pkcs12
    
    truststore from:
    truststore.jks, config/truststore.jks, truststore.pkcs12 or config/truststore.pkcs12
    
    Determine type by extension (jks or pkcs12) and read password from the file with
    the same name as keystore by instead of .jks or .pkcs12 extension it will use
    .credentials extension. Password should be in file as is - do not add CR or LF 
    as it would be used as part of the password!
