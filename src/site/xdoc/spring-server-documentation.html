      <h2>Intruduction</h2>
      <p>
        Spring Application Server is simple, highly configurable and light-weight application container
        based on <a href="#Spring">Spring Framework</a>. Server components are POJOs defined under the Spring Framework
        that is extended to provide support for services.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="#JBoss">JBoss</a> was used as an inspiration for Spring Application Server so there are similarities with
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a pure Java open source project it is an ideally positioned platform for further research of
        application container functionality within enterprise scale applications.
      </p>

      <a name="overview"></a>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Spring Application Server is composed of a server core and a set of modules.
      </p>

      <a name="overview.core"></a><h3>Server Core</h3>
      <p>
        The server core
        (<a href="api/org/abstracthorizon/spring/server/Server.html">Server</a>)
        is started by a bootstrap loader that sets a minimal class loader needed for
        running of the server. The server core then sets up further class loader with all supplied jars from a lib directory and
        creates an application context from configuration xml file (which is <a href="Spring">Spring Framework</a>'s application context file).
        After that, it registers self with that application context as an singleton bean with the name &quot;Server&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        The server then starts deployment of a given URL. If not URL is supplied for server to run from a default location (directory
        named &quot;server&quot; is used instead. The deployment is done by
        obtaining &quot;DeploymentManager&quot; bean of
        <a href="api/org/abstracthorizon/spring/server/deployment/DeploymentManager.html">DeploymentManager</a>
        type and &quot;DeploymentDirectoryModuleLoader&quot; of
        <a href="api/org/abstracthorizon/spring/server/deployment/support/DeploymentDirectoryModuleLoader.html">DeploymentDirectoryModuleLoader</a>
        type. The later is then used for the given URL to be deployed with.
      </p>
      <a name="overview.modules"></a><h3>Modules</h3>
      <p>
        The server is organised around
        <a href="api/org/abstracthorizon/spring/server/deployment/Module.html">Module</a>s.
        Each module describes an unit that exists within a server's boundaries.
        The modules are organised in a hierarcy of dependancies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modules have well defined life cycle:
        <ul>
          <li>UNDEFINED - each module starts with that state. Some modules stay forever in it.</li>
          <li>DEFINED - this state is assigned to the module as soon as it is &quot;created&quot; and important properties assigned to it.</li>
          <li>WAITING_ON_DEPENDENCY - this is internal state to denote that module is waiting for other modules this module depends on to be CREATED.</li>
          <li>CREATED - is assigned to the module when it is created and that can happen only if all modules this module depends on are created.
                        This state is set after a module's <code>create</code> method is succesfully called.
          </li>
          <li>DEPLOYED - a state that is assigned when the module is started (deployed). It is set after module's <code>start</code> method is called.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br clear="all" />

      <a name="overview.module.loaders"></a><h3>Module Loaders</h3>
      <p>
        Modules are delivered to the system (loaded) by
        <a href="api/org/abstracthorizon/spring/server/deployment/ModuleLoader.html">ModuleLoader</a>s.
        When an URL is supplied to the server as a source of a module, all defined module loaders are checked in turn
        (in the order they are defined in the system) to load that URL. If the module returns <code>true</code>
        on call of
        <a href="api/org/abstracthorizon/spring/server/deployment/ModuleLoader.html#canLoad()">canLoad</a>
        method, delegation of loading of that module is passed to that module loader. A concrete class of
        loaded module is actually defined by the module loader.
      </p>
      <br clear="all" />

      <a name="overview.service.archives"></a><h3>Service Archives</h3>
      <p>
        There is one type of modules defined in the core part of the server: Service Archives.
        Those are modules that are defined in jar archives or directories with &quot;.sar&quot; extensions.
        For each service archive an application context is created and bean definitions loaded from
        a file named &quot;service.xml&quot;. All jar files in the root of the archive as well as archive
        itself are used to form a classpath.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application context has access to all application contexts of the modules this module depends on.
        Same stands to the class loaders.
      </p>
      <p>
        The service archive extends definition of an XML files adding &quot;&ltservice&gt;&quot; tag bean definition.
        A presence of that tag denotes that bean is not ordinary bean but a service bean. The service beans can be
        created, started, stopped and destroyed along with the service module. For each bean these method names
        can be defined using sub-tags: &quot;&lt;create-method&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;start-method&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;stop-method&gt;&quot;
        and &quot;&lt;destroy-method&gt;&quot;. By omitting any of these sub-tags the service archive will use
        default values &quot;create&quot;, &quot;start&quot;, &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;destroy&quot;. Making
        tags with empty value (like &quot;&lt;destroy-method /&gt;&quot;) will signal to the service not to call the method.
        If no argument method doesn't exist then it just wont be called.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this granularity of methods each service has four states in its lifecycle:
        <ul>
          <li>instantiated - when bean is created. It is managed by the spring framework.</li>
          <li>initialised - when bean is fully initialised. It is, too, managed by the spring framework.</li>
          <li>created - when <code>create</code> method is called. It is managed by the spring application server.</li>
          <li>started - when <code>start</code> method is called. That is, too, managed by the spring application server.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br clear="all" />

      <a name="overview.directory.structure"></a><h3>Directory Structure</h3>
      <p>
        Here is directory structure spring application server operates from:
      </p>
      <p>
<pre>
      <root>
        bin
          bootstrap.jar - bootstrap jar file
        lib
          libraries needed for the server to work
        server
          default
            config
              server.xml - the server's application context
            lib
              libraries needed for services - they are going to be visible from all modules
            deploy
              directory that contains deployable modules (.sar archives or directories, .war, etc...)
</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is possible for different server directory to be used instead of the default. It is done
        by supplying argument -c &lt;name of subdirectory&gt; while starting bootstrap.jar.
        That directory is the directory the rest of the code is going to be executed from.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, path of the server directory can be specified as an argument
        -server followed by URL while starting bootstrap.jar.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <a name="security"></a>
      <h2>Security</h2>

      <p>
        Spring application server provides simple way of defining security configuration. Bean called
        <a href="api/org/abstracthorizon/spring/server/auth/SpringAuthConfiguration.html">SpringAuthConfiguration</a>
        hooks to system configuration (<code>javax.security.auth.login.Configuration</code>) and allows
        login modules to be specified under login contexts.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the moment there is only one login module implementation supplied:
        <a href="api/org/abstracthorizon/spring/server/auth/jaas/keystore/KeyStoreLoginModule.html">KeyStoreLoginModule</a> and
        <a href="api/org/abstracthorizon/spring/server/auth/jaas/keystore/KeyStoreModuleService.html">KeyStoreModuleService</a> service
        to be used to configure
        <a href="api/org/abstracthorizon/spring/server/auth/jaas/keystore/KeyStoreLoginModule.html">KeyStoreLoginModule</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Service <a href="api/org/abstracthorizon/spring/server/auth/jaas/keystore/KeyStoreModuleService.html">KeyStoreModuleService</a>
        has following attributes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>loginContext</code> - login context name</li>
        <li><code>configuration</code> - configuration bean (usually just reference to &quot;javax.security.auth.login&quot;)</li>
        <li><code>keyStore</code> - name of resource of key store</li>
        <li><code>keyStorePassword</code> - password of given keystore</li>
        <li><code>keyStoreType</code> - type of key store (optional)</li>
        <li><code>keyStoreProvider</code> - key store provider (optional)</li>
        <li><code>controlFlag</code> - control flag - one of &quot;required&quot;, &quot;requisite&quot;, &quot;sufficient&quot; or &quot;optional&quot;. Defaulted to &quot;required&quot;.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For example of a login module definition see bean-console's <code>web-application.xml</code>.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div>
      <a name="integration"></a>
      <h2>Integration</h2>

      <p>
        The spring application server is easily expanded using a service modules. The service modules always have
        access to all modules they depend on and access to the core server's application context.
      </p>
      <div>
        <a name="integration.danube"></a>
        <h3>Danube</h3>
        <p>
          Integration with <a href="#Danube">Danube</a> is done through several service archives:
          main, web server one, danube-velocity, danube-freemarker and danube-spring webflow modules. The Danube archive sets up an web server
          while others are integrations of <a href="#Danube">Danube</a> with respectively
          <a href="#Velocity">Velocity</a>, <a href="#FreeMarker">FreeMarker</a> and <a href="#Spring-Webflow">Spring Webflow</a> providing
          glue code, spring application server code (for correcting paths - for paths to appear archive centric),
          appropriate third party libraries and configurations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The integration provides module and module loader implementations. For an archive or a directory to be considered to be
          loaded by this integration it has to have suffix &quot;.war&quot; and must have file named &quot;web-service.xml&quot;
          in the root of the archive. The module provides an application context read from the &quot;web-service.xml&quot; file.
          Unlike in the service archive here no beans are treated as services. Aside that, class loading and application context
          enclosing are the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon the module is deployed and started an bean named &quot;web-application&quot; of
          <a href="http://www.abstracthorizon.org/danube/api/org/abstracthorizon/danube/connection/ConnectionHandler">ConnectionHandler</a>
          type is obtained and passed to a
          <a href="http://www.abstracthorizon.org/danube/api/org/abstracthorizon/danube/http/matcher/Prefix">Prefix</a>,
          using module's name as first part of the context path, to the main selector of Danube.
          If special tag &lt;context-path&gt; is added at the beginning of the beans section of the xml file then that
          string is going to be used instead.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <a name="integration.jetty"></a>
        <h3>Jetty</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="#Tetty">Jetty</a> web server is added in a similar way as Danube - as an service archive defining module loader
          that knows how to load an archive (or a directory) that ends with &quot;.war&quot; and has &quot;WEB-INF/web.xml&quot; file
          in it. This later one is for J2EE web applications to be distinguished from Danube's web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          A J2EE web application module is deployed under context path of module's name, but
          if application context file &quot;WEB-INF/web-application.xml&quot; exists and special tag &lt;context-path&gt; is added at
          the beginning of the beans section then that string is used instead.
        </p>

        <h3>Tomcat</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="#Tomcat">Tomcat</a> web server is added in a similar way as Danube - as an service archive defining module loader
          that knows how to load an archive (or a directory) that ends with &quot;.war&quot; and has &quot;WEB-INF/web.xml&quot; file
          in it. This later one is for J2EE web applications to be distinguished from Danube's web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          A J2EE web application module is deployed under context path of module's name, but
          if application context file &quot;WEB-INF/web-application.xml&quot; exists and special tag &lt;context-path&gt; is added at
          the beginning of the beans section then that string is used instead.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <a name="integration.other"></a>
        <h3>Other</h3>
        <p>
          There are other technologies that will benefit of being adopted to run under the Spring Application Server.
          Spring Framework's simplicity and power of configuration is the major benefit any component can have from being adopted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adding new elements to the spring application server can be done by simply adoptoing
          <a href="api/org/abstracthorizon/spring/server/deployment/Module.html">Module</a>
          and if needed
          <a href="api/org/abstracthorizon/spring/server/deployment/ModuleLoader.html">ModuleLoader</a>
          interfaces. Using service archives, the spring framework for configuration and
          the server for handing life cycle are tools for adopting independent pieces of software to work
          with the Spring Application Server.

        <a name="examples.bean-console"></a>
        <h3>Bean Console</h3>
        <p>
          The bean console is simple web application for <a href="#Danube">Danube</a> web application server that allows access to
          all beans defined in the root application context. It allows bean properties to be displayed using available
          property editors, read-write properties to be altered and public method to be called.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bean console is installed on &quot;/bean-console&quot; context path of local web server running on port 8080
          (&quot;http://localhost:8080/bean-console&quot;). It is implemented using <a href="#Danube">Danube</a>,
          <a href="#Spring-WebFlow">Spring Webflow</a> and <a href="#FreeMarker">FreeMarker</a>. Source code is supplied.
