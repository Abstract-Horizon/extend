      <p>
        As soon as Extend is stared you can point your web browser to http://localhost:8080/bean-console.
        Current configuration will enforce SSL (switch to https://) and ask you for username and password:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Username: <b>admin</b></li>
        <li>Password: <b>admin123</b></li>
      </ul>

    <section name="Help">
      <p>
        Extend is built around simplicity and transparency.
        If there is a part missing it shouldn't be hard to be added.
        If you decide to do so and want to share that code with rest of the world we would be more then happy for it to
        appear within the <a href="http://www.abstracthorizon.org">Abstract Horizon</a> open source project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every kind of help is more then welcome - from coding, designing to testing (using it) or commenting on it.
