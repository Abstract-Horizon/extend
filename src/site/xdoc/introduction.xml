      <p>
        Extend is simple, highly configurable and light-weight application container
        based on <a href="links.html#Spring">Spring Framework</a>. Server components are POJOs defined under the Spring Framework
        that is extended to provide support for services.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="links.html#JBoss">JBoss</a> was used as an inspiration for Extend so there are similarities with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a pure Java open source project it is an ideally positioned platform for further research of
        application container functionality within enterprise scale applications.
